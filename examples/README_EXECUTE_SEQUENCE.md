# MCP Execute Sequence - Detailed Step Tracking

This implementation enhances the `execute_sequence` tool in the terminator-mcp-agent to provide detailed step-by-step execution information, simulating a streaming-like experience for MCP clients.

## Overview

Since the MCP (Model Context Protocol) doesn't natively support streaming tool results, this implementation provides a comprehensive structured response that includes:

1. **Execution Plan** - Shows all steps that will be executed
2. **Step Results** - Detailed information for each executed step
3. **Execution Summary** - Overall statistics and timing

## Features

### Enhanced execute_sequence Tool

The modified `execute_sequence` tool now returns:

```json
{
  "action": "execute_sequence",
  "status": "success",
  "execution_plan": {
    "total_steps": 4,
    "steps": [
      {
        "step": 1,
        "tool_name": "get_applications",
        "description": "Get list of running applications",
        "status": "pending"
      }
    ]
  },
  "execution_summary": {
    "total_steps": 4,
    "executed_steps": 4,
    "successful_steps": 4,
    "failed_steps": 0,
    "total_duration_ms": 2543,
    "started_at": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z",
    "completed_at": "2024-01-10T10:30:02.543Z"
  },
  "step_results": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "tool_name": "get_applications",
      "status": "success",
      "started_at": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z",
      "completed_at": "2024-01-10T10:30:00.500Z",
      "duration_ms": 500,
      "progress": "1/4",
      "result": {
        "type": "tool_result",
        "content_count": 1,
        "content": [...]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Python Client Examples

### 1. Simple Example (python_mcp_sequence_simple.py)

A minimal example that shows the basic usage:

```python
# Run the simple demo
python examples/python_mcp_sequence_simple.py
```

This example:
- Connects to the MCP server
- Executes a simple sequence (get apps, delay, screenshot, clipboard)
- Displays step-by-step results in a clean format

### 2. Advanced Example (python_mcp_sequence_demo.py)

A more advanced example with colored output and real automation:

```python
# Install required packages
pip install mcp python-dotenv colorama

# Run the advanced demo
python examples/python_mcp_sequence_demo.py
```

This example:
- Uses colored output for better visualization
- Executes a real automation sequence (opens Notepad, types text, saves file)
- Shows detailed timing and progress information
- Handles errors gracefully

## Usage

### Building the MCP Agent

First, ensure the terminator-mcp-agent is built:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin terminator-mcp-agent
```

### Running the Examples

1. **Simple Demo** - Best for understanding the structure:
   ```bash
   python examples/python_mcp_sequence_simple.py
   ```

2. **Advanced Demo** - Shows real automation with detailed output:
   ```bash
   python examples/python_mcp_sequence_demo.py
   ```

### Creating Your Own Sequences

To create your own sequence:

```python
sequence = [
    {
        "tool_name": "open_application",
        "arguments": {"app_name": "calculator"}
    },
    {
        "tool_name": "delay",
        "arguments": {"delay_ms": 1000}
    },
    {
        "tool_name": "click_element",
        "arguments": {"selector": "button|7"}
    }
]

# Convert to JSON and call execute_sequence
tools_json = json.dumps(sequence)
result = await session.call_tool(
    "execute_sequence",
    arguments={
        "tools_json": tools_json,
        "stop_on_error": True,
        "include_detailed_results": True
    }
)
```

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Changes

The `execute_sequence` tool in `terminator-mcp-agent/src/server.rs` was enhanced to:

1. Generate an execution plan before starting
2. Track detailed timing for each step
3. Include progress indicators (e.g., "2/5")
4. Provide structured step results with status
5. Generate a comprehensive execution summary

### Client-Side Processing

The Python clients demonstrate how to:

1. Parse the structured response
2. Display execution plan before execution
3. Show step-by-step results as they complete
4. Present a final summary with statistics

## Benefits

1. **Visibility** - See what will happen before execution starts
2. **Progress Tracking** - Know which step is executing and how many remain
3. **Debugging** - Detailed timing and error information for each step
4. **Automation** - Structure makes it easy to build automation pipelines

## Future Enhancements

While this implementation provides detailed execution information, true streaming could be added when MCP supports:

1. Progress notifications during tool execution
2. Partial results streaming
3. Real-time status updates

Until then, this structured approach provides the next best thing - comprehensive execution details that can be displayed progressively by clients.
