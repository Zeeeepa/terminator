# YAML Workflow Examples

This document showcases simple end-to-end **Terminator** workflows written in YAML that you can run on **Windows** today. Each example is powered by the `execute_sequence` tool exposed by `terminator-mcp-agent`.

> ðŸ‘‰ **How to run**
>
> 1. Make sure the MCP agent is installed and the Terminator workspace is built:
>    ```bash
>    cargo build --release
>    ```
> 2. Execute a workflow (replace the path with the one you want to try):
>    ```bash
>    ./target/release/gist-executor examples/workflows/notepad_type.yaml
>    ```
>    or load the YAML in a Cursor/VS Code MCP session and click *Run*.

## 1. `notepad_type.yaml`

Automates **Notepad**:

1. Launches `notepad.exe`.
2. Waits for the edit pane to appear.
3. Types custom text (parameterised via `text_to_type`).
4. Closes Notepad.

```yaml
# abbreviated for readability
steps:
  - open_application (notepad.exe)
  - wait_for_element (edit area)
  - type_into_element ("Hello, Terminator!")
  - close_element (window)
```

## 2. `calculator_addition.yaml`

Automates **Windows Calculator**:

1. Launches Calculator.
2. Clicks `7 + 3 =`.
3. Waits until the result display reads **10**.
4. Closes the Calculator window.

```yaml
steps:
  - open_application (calc)
  - click_element (7 â†’ + â†’ 3 â†’ =)
  - wait_for_element (display is 10)
  - close_element (window)
```
