# YAML Workflow Examples

This document showcases simple end-to-end **Terminator** workflows written in YAML that you can run on **Windows** today. Each example is powered by the `execute_sequence` tool exposed by `terminator-mcp-agent`.

> ðŸ‘‰ **How to run**
>
> 1. Make sure the MCP agent is installed and the Terminator workspace is built:
>    ```bash
>    cargo build --release
>    ```
> 2. Execute a workflow (replace the path with the one you want to try):
>    ```bash
>    ./target/release/gist-executor examples/workflows/notepad_type.yaml
>    ```
>    or load the YAML in a Cursor/VS Code MCP session and click *Run*.

## 1. `notepad_type.yaml`

Automates **Notepad**:

1. Launches `notepad.exe`.
2. Waits for the edit pane to appear.
3. Types custom text (parameterised via `text_to_type`).
4. Closes Notepad.

```yaml
# abbreviated for readability
steps:
  - open_application (notepad.exe)
  - wait_for_element (edit area)
  - type_into_element ("Hello, Terminator!")
  - close_element (window)
```

## 2. `calculator_addition.yaml`

Automates **Windows Calculator**:

1. Launches Calculator.
2. Clicks `7 + 3 =`.
3. Waits until the result display reads **10**.
4. Closes the Calculator window.

```yaml
steps:
  - open_application (calc)
  - click_element (7 â†’ + â†’ 3 â†’ =)
  - wait_for_element (display is 10)
  - close_element (window)
```

Feel free to duplicate these files under `examples/workflows/` and iterate on them for your own automation scenarios.

## 3. `x_follow_basic.yaml`

Automates **X.com** (Twitter):

1. Opens https://x.com.
2. Waits until a `Follow` button is visible.
3. Runs **five** scroll + follow cycles:
   - Click the first visible `Follow` button (if any).
   - Scrolls the timeline (`PageDown`).
   - Short delay to let new content load.
4. Optionally closes the browser tab with `{Ctrl}{W}`.

This is a straightforward, unrolled loopâ€”handy for demo purposes.

## 4. `x_follow_advanced.yaml`

A slightly more sophisticated variant that:

1. Opens X.com and waits for the feed.
2. Executes three *batch* cycles where each cycle:
   - Attempts to click up to three visible `Follow` buttons (using `continue_on_error` so the workflow keeps going if none are found).
   - Scrolls **twice** (`PageDown`) to load fresh content.
   - Waits 1.5 s between cycles for stability.
3. Closes the tab at the end.

Feel free to duplicate and extend these YAMLsâ€”e.g. increase the number of click attempts per cycle or add more cyclesâ€”to suit your own growth-hacking experiments.
