# Cursor Automation Test

## Overview

This feature adds automated testing for the Terminator project using a meta-automation approach: **Terminator automating Cursor to test Terminator itself**. This validates the project's core functionality in a real-world scenario by demonstrating cross-application automation capabilities.

## What It Does

The automated test:

1. **üñ•Ô∏è Runs on Windows** - Uses GitHub Actions Windows runner
2. **üì• Downloads and installs Cursor** - Fresh installation for each test
3. **üöÄ Opens the Terminator repository in Cursor** - Loads the project context
4. **ü§ñ Interacts with Cursor's AI chat** - Uses multiple methods to access AI features
5. **üí¨ Tests various prompts** - Specifically designed to test Terminator knowledge
6. **üì∏ Captures everything** - Screenshots throughout the entire process
7. **üìä Generates comprehensive reports** - Both human-readable and machine-processable results

## Test Scenarios

The automation tests the following scenarios:

### 1. Basic Calculator Automation
- **Prompt**: "Using terminator library, write a Python script to automate Windows Calculator..."
- **Purpose**: Tests basic desktop automation knowledge and code generation

### 2. Notepad Text Manipulation  
- **Prompt**: "Create a terminator script to open Windows Notepad..."
- **Purpose**: Validates text input and application launching capabilities

### 3. Project Explanation
- **Prompt**: "What is the terminator library? Explain its purpose..."
- **Purpose**: Tests AI understanding of the project's core concepts

### 4. Error Handling Patterns
- **Prompt**: "Show how to properly handle errors when using terminator..."
- **Purpose**: Validates advanced usage patterns and best practices

### 5. Advanced Locator Usage
- **Prompt**: "Demonstrate advanced locator patterns in terminator..."
- **Purpose**: Tests knowledge of complex UI element selection

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- **`.github/workflows/cursor-automation-test.yml`** - Main GitHub Action workflow
- **`scripts/cursor_automation_enhanced.py`** - Enhanced automation script with robust error handling
- **`docs/cursor-automation-test.md`** - This documentation file

### Key Features

- Multiple keyboard shortcut attempts for opening AI chat
- PowerShell integration for reliable input simulation

#### üì∑ High-Quality Screenshots
- PIL/ImageGrab for primary screenshot capture
- PowerShell fallback for screenshot reliability
- Timestamped and descriptive file naming

#### üìà Comprehensive Reporting
- Markdown reports for human consumption
- JSON reports for automated analysis
- Performance metrics and success rates
- Detailed test artifact listings

## Artifacts Generated

Each test run produces:

### Screenshots
- `001_000s_initial_desktop.png` - Initial state
- `002_015s_cursor_launching.png` - During Cursor startup
- `003_020s_cursor_loaded.png` - Cursor fully loaded
- `004_025s_chat_interface.png` - AI chat interface
- `test_01_basic_calculator_test.png` - Individual test screenshots
- ... and more for each test phase

### Reports
- `automation_report.md` - Human-readable test summary
- `automation_report.json` - Machine-readable test data
- `summary.md` - Quick overview with artifact listings

## Usage

### Automatic Execution
The test runs automatically on:
- Pull requests (opened, synchronized, reopened)
- Pushes to main branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Manual Trigger
You can manually trigger the test:
1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Cursor Automation Test"
3. Click "Run workflow"

### Viewing Results
1. Navigate to the workflow run
2. Check the "Summary" tab for quick overview
3. Download artifacts:
   - `cursor-automation-screenshots-{run_id}` - All screenshots
   - `cursor-automation-test-results-{run_id}` - Reports and data

## Success Criteria

The test evaluates success based on:

- **‚úÖ 80%+ success rate**: EXCELLENT - Terminator working very well
- **‚ö†Ô∏è 60-79% success rate**: GOOD - Mostly working with minor issues  
- **‚ö†Ô∏è 40-59% success rate**: PARTIAL - Some automation issues detected
- **‚ùå <40% success rate**: ISSUES - Significant problems found

## Benefits

### For Development
- **Validates core functionality** in real-world scenarios
- **Catches regressions** before they reach users
- **Documents capabilities** through automated examples
- **Tests cross-application automation** (meta-testing)

### For Users
- **Demonstrates real usage** of Terminator with modern tools
- **Provides confidence** in the project's reliability
- **Shows integration possibilities** with AI-powered editors
- **Validates Windows compatibility** in CI environment

### For Maintainers  
- **Automated quality assurance** for releases
- **Visual documentation** of features through screenshots
- **Performance tracking** over time
- **Integration testing** without manual intervention

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cursor Installation Fails
- Check download URL availability
- Verify Windows runner compatibility
- Review PowerShell execution policies

#### Window Detection Problems
- UI automation depends on Windows accessibility
- Different Cursor versions may have different UI patterns
- Screenshot artifacts help diagnose detection issues

#### Test Timeouts
- AI response times can vary
- Network connectivity affects Cursor functionality
- Timeout values are configurable in the script

### Debugging

The test produces extensive logging and screenshots at each step, making it easy to:
- Identify exactly where failures occur
- Understand UI state during automation
- Debug accessibility element detection issues
- Analyze timing and performance problems

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Multi-platform support** (macOS, Linux) 
- **Performance benchmarking** across Cursor versions
- **Extended test scenarios** for advanced Terminator features
- **Integration with other AI editors** (VS Code Copilot, etc.)
- **Automated video recording** of test sessions
- **Response content validation** using OCR or accessibility APIs

## Contributing

To extend or modify the automation tests:

1. Edit test scenarios in `scripts/cursor_automation_enhanced.py`
2. Update the `TEST_PROMPTS` array with new test cases
3. Modify timeout values and error handling as needed
4. Test locally on Windows before submitting PR
5. Update this documentation for any significant changes

The automation framework is designed to be extensible and maintainable, making it easy to add new test scenarios as the project evolves.
