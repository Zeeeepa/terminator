warning: output filename collision.
The lib target `terminator` in package `terminator-py-bindings v0.16.10 (C:\Users\screenpipe-windows\terminator\bindings\python)` has the same output filename as the bin target `terminator` in package `terminator-cli v0.16.10 (C:\Users\screenpipe-windows\terminator\terminator-cli)`.
Colliding filename is: C:\Users\screenpipe-windows\terminator\target\release\deps\terminator.pdb
The targets should have unique names.
Consider changing their names to be unique or compiling them separately.
This may become a hard error in the future; see <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6313>.
