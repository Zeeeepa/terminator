**Terminator** is the fastest, AI-first, computer use SDK. It's designed to interact with native GUI applications on Windows using a Playwright-like API, like parsing a website. By leveraging OS-level accessibility APIs, Terminator is significantly faster and more reliable for AI agents than vision-based approaches, and can interact with background applications.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental ‚ö†Ô∏è:** Terminator is under active development. Expect bugs and breaking changes. Please report issues ‚Äì we aim to fix them quickly!

Get up and running with Terminator:

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator
    cd terminator
    ```
2.  **Set up the server:**
    *   **Windows:** Download & unzip the pre-built server using PowerShell:
        ```powershell
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup_windows.ps1
        ```
    *   **macOS:** Compile the server using Rust/Cargo (ensure Rust and Xcode Command Line Tools are installed):
        ```bash
        cargo build --release --package server
        ```
3.  **Run the server:**
    *   **Windows:**
        ```powershell
        ./server_release/server.exe --debug
        ```
    *   **macOS:**
        ```bash
        ./target/release/examples/server --debug
        ```
4.  **Run an example client (in a separate terminal):**
    Navigate to the example directory, install dependencies, and run:
    ```bash
    cd examples/hello-world
    npm i
    npm run dev
    # Then, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
    ```

## Technical Details & Debugging

### Key Dependencies
*   **Windows:** [uiautomation-rs](https://github.com/leexgone/uiautomation-rs)
*   **macOS:** Native macOS Accessibility API (exploring [cidre](https://github.com/yury/cidre) as an alternative)

### Debugging Tools
*   **Windows:**
    *   [Accessibility Insights for Windows](https://accessibilityinsights.io/downloads/)
    *   **FlaUInspect:** A recommended alternative for inspecting UI Automation properties on Windows.
        *   Install: `choco install flauinspect` or download from [FlaUI/FlaUInspect releases](https://github.com/FlaUI/FlaUInspect/releases).
        *   Usage: Launch `FlaUInspect.exe`, hover or click on elements to see properties like `AutomationId`, `Name`, and `ControlType`. This is great for debugging selectors.
